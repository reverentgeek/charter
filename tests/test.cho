{comment: Verse 1}
[Ab]   [Eb]I walk a bit different [Bb]now   [Cm]
Now that my heart's been [Ab]found, [Eb]nothing really feels the [Bb]same
[Ab] I hold my [Eb]head a bit higher,  [Bb] I lift my [Cm]voice a bit louder
[Ab] Yeah [Eb]something inside has [Bb]changed

{comment: Chorus 1}
I am a [Ab]mountain mov - [Eb]er, water-walker, [Cm]more than just [Bb]an overcomer
[Ab] 'Cause [Eb]I've been set [Bb]free
I am a [Ab]gospel preach - [Eb]er, heart on fire, [Cm]freedom sing - [Bb]ing testifier
[Ab] 'Cause [Eb]I've been re - [Bb]deemed
I am a believer  [Ab]    [Eb]    [Cm]    [Bb] (2nd x to Br.)
I am a believer  [Ab]    [Eb]    [Bb]
{end_of_chorus}

{comment: Verse 2}
[Ab]   [Eb]I know this is not my [Bb]home   [Cm]
I know I don't walk a - [Ab]lone,   [Eb]no matter what comes [Bb]my way
[Ab] I have [Eb] peace through the trouble,  [Bb] I have [Cm] joy through the struggle
[Ab] And now my  [Eb] hope's in a brighter [Bb]day (To Ch.)
{end_of_verse}

{comment: Bridge}
I am a [Ab]child of the Father, an [Eb]orphan no longer
No [Cm]doubt about who I [Bb]am
I'm in the [Ab]hands of the Healer, the [Eb]arms of the Savior
His [Cm]grace makes me who I [Bb]am (To Ch.)
